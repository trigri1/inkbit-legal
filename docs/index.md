# InkBit Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** February 17, 2026

InkBit works without accounts. You can use the app without sharing your name, email, or phone number. Journal entries and reflections stay on your device unless you choose to share them.

## 1. Local Data (On Your Device)
- Your journal entries, favorites, reflections, and app preferences (for example theme, reminders, and app-lock setting) are stored locally on your device.
- This local content is not uploaded to our servers by default.

## 2. Analytics and Crash Reports
- We use Firebase Analytics to understand feature usage, such as screen opens, interactions, and navigation patterns.
- We use Firebase Crashlytics to collect crash and diagnostic data, such as app version, device details, stack traces, and breadcrumbs, so we can fix issues.

## 3. Notifications
- If you enable push notifications, Firebase Cloud Messaging may process a device token and topic subscription to deliver messages to your device.
- Daily reading reminders and daily journal reminders are scheduled locally on your device, based on your notification settings.

## 4. Security and App Lock
- If you enable app lock, biometric or device credential checks are handled by your operating system. InkBit receives only the authentication result (success or failure).
- When app lock is enabled, Android recent-app snapshots are protected to reduce content exposure.

## 5. Content Updates
- When a notification payload includes a secure update URL, the app may download updated reading content (JSON).
- When your device makes content or update requests, delivery providers (including hosting/CDN services and Google Play) may receive standard connection or update metadata, such as IP address, app version, and install status.

## 6. Data Sharing
- We do not sell your personal data.
- We share data only with service providers required to operate the app, including Firebase/Google, Google Play, and content hosting. If you use share, content is sent only to the app you select.

## 7. Your Choices
- You can disable notifications in your device settings.
- You can disable app lock at any time in app settings.
- You can remove local app data by clearing app storage or uninstalling the app.

## 8. Contact
- Email: trigri1@gmail.com
